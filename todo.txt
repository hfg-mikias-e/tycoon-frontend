MVP:

- player slot behavior on when a player leaves
- add message for special cases (+ static information for active revolution)
- add game rules instructions
- make a lobby unjoinable after the game has started
- screen information when the server is still waking up or access denied because of multiple tabs

important for a possible release:

- contact and support info

nice, but not necessary for now:

- multiple rounds with points and roles/ranks
- show open rooms
- edit your username
- friends?
